Hardwood Species is begging you to use an STL map. The only thing to do in this problem if you do happen to be using a map is to
1. read each ENTIRE line in
2. add that line's contents to the map as a key if its not already in there
3. increment the matching value mapped to the key
4. print the map out after the file is read in

The only issue I ran into in this problem was getting confused initially because I wasn't realizing that I had to read the entire line in.
So I would be getting values for "Yellow" and "Birch" instead of one value for "Yellow Birch".
