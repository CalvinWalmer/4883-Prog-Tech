Composite Prime is a problem that requests that you find out if a number is a composite prime or not. A composite prime is a number in Mthat does not have any divisor (except
itself) in the set M. So what that boils down to is that if the prime factorization of a number has 2 terms then it is indeed a composite prime. I came across this conclusion
by trial an error with the small input file.
