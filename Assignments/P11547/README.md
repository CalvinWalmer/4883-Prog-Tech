This problem is easy and just involves some math operations. Here is the question from the problem:

For each test case, output the answer to the following skill testing question on a line by itself:
“Multiply nby 567, then divide the result by 9, then add 7492, then multiply by 235, then divide
by 47, then subtract 498. What is the digit in the tens column?”

So I coded all the math operations and then dvided by 10 and modded by 10 to get the digit in the 10's place. Simple!
