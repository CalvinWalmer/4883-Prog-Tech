This problem provides a list of coordinates and asks you to determine in which quadrant the coordinate is in. The coordinates of the borders are also provided.
I thought this was a pretty simple one. My idea was just to keep the coordinates of the border stored in a variable (yep) and then compare the incoming coordinate pairs
to the stored border value to see if the value was to the left or right of the Y-border, or above or below the X-border. If a coordinate fell upon a border coordinate in
any direction then "divisa" was printed. otherwise two letters were printed to show which coordinate the pair fell in:
"NE", Northeast, for Quadrant 1
"NO", Northwest, for Quantrant 2
"SO", Southwest, for Quadrant 3
"SE", Southeast, for Quantrant 4
and "divisa" for anything on a border.

The problem asked for the abbreviations and "divisa" in portuguese.
