We Ship Cheap is a shortest path problem on a non-directed unweighted graph. 
For this problem i took code from geeks for geeks to solve exactly that! 
The code I took was to solve for the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

For we ship cheap a series of edges are given that connect two nodes, the goal is to minimize the number of edges used to get to a totally different node.

After i identified the algorithm i needed to use, all that was left for me to do was to format the data in a way that could be plugged into the code!
