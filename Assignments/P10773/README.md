For this problem a boat is trying to cross a river that is d wide and is flowing at a rate of v. The boat can have a velocity u in the opposite direction of the river's flow.
The goal is to find the difference in times if the boat uses its engine or just follows the flow of the river. This results in two paths, the shortest distance, and the shortest time.

I knew i needed to use the formula x = vt but solved for t so t = x/v. The time for the "go with the flow" or shortest time approach was simply t = d/v where v is the velocity of the river.
Now that I knew how to get the shortest time path I knew I needed the combined velocities for the shortest distance path. This was done by squaring the two velocities and then taking the square root.
I did some checks to assure that the result would be a real, positive, non-zero, time value.
