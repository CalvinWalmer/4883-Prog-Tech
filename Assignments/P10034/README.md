Freckles is a minimum spanning tree problem that asks for the minimum distance to connect all of the freckles on Dick Van Dyke's back.

For this problem I used an implementation of a minimum spanning tree algorithm. I decided to go with Kruskal's algorithm so I went to geeks
for geeks and found some code that solved a minimum spanning tree using kruskal's algorithm. Then I fortmatted the data so that the code I
used could accept the input.
