This problem is an easy kinematics problem. The relevant equation is:

x = v_0t + (1/2)at^2

The problem asks: For a given inital velocity and time, how far will a particle have travled from t=0.
Becasue there is no acceleration, the equation reduces to

x = v_0t

And, because we want to know how much distance was traveled in TWICE the time, we sub in 2t for t yielding:

x = 2 * v_0 * t

This was the equation I used, all that was left to do is read in v and t and print out the resulting x.
