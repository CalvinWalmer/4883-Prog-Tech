Robot motion involves a root traveling on a grid. On each tile of the grid there is an instruction that tells the robot where to go next. The goal of the program
is to find out either how long it takes the robot to exit the grid or to find out how long it takes before it loops.

At first, I was intimidated by trying to find how long the loops were. The time it took the robot to exit seemed simple to me: Just follow instructions until
the robot tried to access a grid spot tht was out of bounds. For this problem I set up a 2d vector of grid spots. Each grid spot contained a character that the robot
was supposed to go next (N,S,E,W). The grid squares also included a boolean to indicate whether or not the square had been visited. Then i implemented a step function to actually move the robot. In order to keep track of the steps that re robot took, I decided
to pass everything into my function by reference. If the step function encounters a square that has already been visited OR a square that is out of bounds, the loop ends. If the loop ends becasue an out of bounds
condition has been reached then the "stepsFor" variable will have a value and "loopsFor" will be 0. If the loop ends becasue a square has already been visited then the oppositew will be true.

This problem used a sort of memoization to keep track of where the robot had been before.
